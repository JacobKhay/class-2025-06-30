Using sf and ggplot2, we generated a choropleth map showing income distribution across the state. The resulting visualization reveals clear geographic variation in income levels, with higher median incomes concentrated around the Greater Boston area and lower levels in more rural and western parts of the state.\nThis type of analysis provides valuable insight into regional income disparities and can inform discussions on economic inequality, resource allocation, and public policy."
